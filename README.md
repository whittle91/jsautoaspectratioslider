jsautoaspectratioslider
=======================

JavaScript Aspect Ratio controlled slider
I couldn't find a slider which would allow an image not to be streched 
or cropped or resized, so I created this slider which changes the aspect 
ratio of the image, so that you can see the whole image without any tampering.
